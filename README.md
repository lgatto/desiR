desiR
=====

This package is used to rank, select, and prioritise items based on multiple characteristics or criteria. The functions have mainly been used in the context of high-dimensional biology experiments and therefore the 'items' are genes, proteins, or metabolites. Please see the vignette on [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/desiR/) for an example with a microarray data set.
